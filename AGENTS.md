# AGENTS.md — Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol & Engineering Standards

> **Project:** HoldMeToIt (Gamified Study Accountability & Challenge Management Platform)  
> **Repository:** Absolute source of truth. All contributing human engineers and AI agents are equal peers.  
> **Rule:** No single agent owns the codebase. Quality gates and stack laws apply unconditionally.  
> **Last Updated:** 2026-09-05

## 1. Agents & Responsibilities

HoldMeToIt is developed collaboratively by autonomous agents and human developers organized into four specialized functional roles:

| Role / Agent ID | Scope / Focus | Primary Layer Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data & Identity Agent** | Database schema, Prisma migrations, Auth.js Discord OAuth, User/Challenge/Team/Task repositories, session hydration | `prisma/`, `core/db/`, `core/auth/`, `features/auth/`, `features/challenges/data/` |
| **Scoring & Engine Agent** | Domain business math, `HH:MM:SS` duration converters, cumulative team aggregations, dynamic catch-up deficit engine, dual-failure punishment validator, Vitest test suite | `features/leaderboard/domain/`, `features/study-logs/domain/`, `features/accountability/domain/`, domain unit tests |
| **Participant UI Agent** | Student cockpit views, `HH:MM:SS` duration self-logging input, interactive weekly goal checklist, progress meters, mobile viewport responsiveness (360px+) | `features/study-logs/presentation/`, `features/declarations/presentation/`, `app/(dashboard)/`, Tailwind components |
| **Admin Operations & Broadcaster Agent** | Host wizard, team balancer & roster editor, admin inline hours override grid, challenge lock/freeze controls, 1-click Discord summary generator, Punishment PFP hub | `features/challenges/presentation/`, `features/notifications/`, `features/accountability/presentation/`, `app/(admin)/` |

### 1.1 Equality & Collaboration Posture
- All agents and human contributors possess equal authority.
- No agent shall unilaterally overwrite another agent's work without running pre-checks and verifying behavioral regression.
- Work is broken down into parallel-safe vertical slices to minimize file collisions.
- Autonomous agents must strictly adhere to the Document Authority Hierarchy:
  1. `FEATURES.md` has absolute override authority on **product behavior, screen layouts, and roadmap phases**.
  2. `DESIGN.md` has absolute override authority on **visual identity, cozy theme, color palette, typography, and component styling**.
  3. `AGENTS.md` (this file) has absolute override authority on **agent behavior, stack laws, git safety, and quality gates**.
  4. `ROADMAP.md` defines **phased milestones (`[P0]` to `[V2]`) and technical evolution gates**.
  5. `README.md` provides **developer onboarding, repository structure, and local environment setup**.
  *(Note: `HANDOFF.md` will be instantiated at repository root once active codebase implementation begins).*

---

## 2. Development Strategy (Feature-First Vertical Slices)

We adhere strictly to **Feature-First Vertical Slices**. Work units are sliced through all necessary layers for a specific capability rather than horizontally across all files.

### 2.1 Anatomy of a Feature Slice
```text
features/<feature_name>/
├── domain/            # Pure business entities, calculation math, zero framework/ORM imports
├── data/              # Prisma repositories, database queries, external API clients
├── presentation/      # React UI components, client hooks, forms, responsive views
└── api/               # Next.js Route Handlers / Server Actions
```

### 2.2 Definition of Done (DoD) per Slice
A vertical slice or work unit is only complete when:
1. **Typesafe:** Zero TypeScript compiler errors (`npm run typecheck` or `tsc --noEmit` exits with 0).
2. **Tested:** Unit tests for domain logic and math pass with 100% green exit (`npm run test`).
3. **Designed States Handled (Law L9):** Loading skeleton, Empty state, and Error fallback screens are fully implemented.
4. **Mobile Verified:** Layout renders cleanly without horizontal overflow or clipped buttons on a 360px viewport.
5. **Documented:** Session changes, status transitions, and the exact next step are recorded in `HANDOFF.md`.

---

## 3. Baseline Pre-Checks (Before Every Task)

Every agent or developer beginning a task must follow this exact sequential checklist:
1. **Read `AGENTS.md` (this file):** Re-align on stack laws, locked technologies, git safety, and quality gates.
2. **Read `FEATURES.md`:** Review authoritative UX, phase tags (`[P0]`, `[P1]`, `[V1]`, `[V2]`), and product intent for the targeted feature.
3. **Read `DESIGN.md`:** Review cozy color tokens, typography, component blueprints, and mobile responsive rules.
4. **Read `ROADMAP.md`:** Review the active phase milestone, non-goals, and evolution trajectory.
5. **Run Git Pre-Checks:** Execute `git status` and `git log -n 3` to verify working tree cleanliness.
6. **Inspect Target Directory:** Inspect existing code in the target feature folder before writing code; never assume file contents.
7. **Strict Archive Quarantine Policy:** All legacy and background specifications in `.archive/` (`SRS.md`, `MVP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, etc.) are historical references only. Autonomous agents must never modify files in `.archive/` or introduce deprecated mechanics.
8. **Implementation Plans Rule:** Follow planning mode for architectural changes, but do not generate duplicate design documents for items already specified in `FEATURES.md`. Proceed directly to execution.

## 4. Git Workflow & Safety Rules

### 4.1 Branching Strategy
| Branch | Purpose | Merge Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `main` | Production-ready, deployable release code | Peer review + all E2E journeys green |
| `dev` | Shared integration branch for active sprint | All unit/integration tests passing |
| `feature/<slice>` | Vertical slice development branch | Slice Definition of Done satisfied |
| `fix/<slice>` | Hotfixes and defect resolutions | Targeted regression test passing |
| `prototyping` | Early exploratory mockups and wireframes | Team review / visual alignment |

### 4.2 Conventional Commits
All commits must follow the conventional commit format:
- `feat(scope): ...` (New user-facing capability or domain feature)
- `fix(scope): ...` (Defect resolution or bugfix)
- `docs(scope): ...` (Documentation changes or updates)
- `refactor(scope): ...` (Code changes without behavior changes)
- `test(scope): ...` (Adding or updating tests)
- `chore(scope): ...` (Dependency updates, tooling configs)

### 4.3 Strictly Forbidden Git Commands
The following commands are **strictly prohibited** in all environments:
- `git reset --hard` (Data loss hazard)
- `git clean -fd` (Unrecoverable file deletion)
- `git push --force` or `git push -f` (Overwriting shared remote history)
- Rebasing shared public branches (`dev` or `main`)

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution Protocol

When encountering conflicting code or architectural divergence:
1. **STOP:** Halt automated code generation immediately.
2. **INSPECT:** Read git blame and recent commit logs to understand the original author's intent.
3. **UNDERSTAND:** Evaluate which approach adheres more strictly to `FEATURES.md` and the Foundational Stack Laws.
4. **EVALUATE:** If the existing code functions and satisfies tests, preserve it. Improve incrementally rather than replacing wholesale.
5. **DECIDE & LOG:** Document any forced deviations in `HANDOFF.md` under session notes.

---

## 6. Technology Stack (Locked vs Explicitly Rejected)

To eliminate architectural drift, the core technology stack is permanently locked. Any agent introducing dependencies outside this matrix will fail review.

### 6.1 Locked Reference Stack
| Layer / Dimension | Ratified Choice | Version / Tooling | Architectural Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework & Runtime** | Next.js (App Router) | 14+ | Unified fullstack SSR/Client architecture, zero CORS, zero multi-repo overhead |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 5.x | Strict end-to-end type safety (`strict: true`) across UI, API, and DB layers |
| **Styling & Components** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Latest | Atomic utilities, responsive layouts (360px+), accessible Radix UI primitives |
| **Database Engine** | PostgreSQL (Supabase / Neon) | 15+ | Relational data integrity, ACID transactions for batch logging, Discord Snowflake keys |
| **ORM & Migrations** | Prisma ORM | 5.x | Declarative schemas, type-safe queries, migration control |
| **Authentication** | Auth.js (NextAuth.js v5) | Latest | Discord OAuth 2.0 (`identify` scope), session cookie management, spectator fallback |
| **Schema Validation** | Zod | 3.x | Strict runtime payload validation at API boundaries and form inputs |
| **Unit & Math Testing** | Vitest | Latest | Fast ESM test runner for pure domain math and time calculations |
| **Hosting & Deployment** | Vercel | Production | Native Next.js edge and serverless runtime support |

### 6.2 Explicitly Rejected Technologies
The following technologies were evaluated and are **strictly banned** from the codebase:
- ❌ **No Document Stores (MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase Firestore):** Challenge leaderboards, team standings, and user logs are relational by nature. No non-relational stores.
- ❌ **No Custom Password / Email Authentication:** Local passwords, JWT email login, Auth0, or Firebase Auth are rejected. The community lives on Discord; Discord OAuth 2.0 is the sole identity mechanism.
- ❌ **No Heavy Client-Side State Managers (Redux, MobX):** Unnecessary boilerplate. Leverage React Server Components, server actions, and local UI state.
- ❌ **No GraphQL:** REST endpoints and Next.js Server Actions provide direct, type-safe RPC without GraphQL schema overhead.
- ❌ **No 24/7 Discord Bot Daemons in Phase 0 (P0):** A permanent bot service increases hosting costs and operational failure modes. P0 uses a 1-click clipboard markdown copy generator and webhooks. The full `@HoldMeToItBot` daemon is reserved for Phase 1 (P1).
- ❌ **No In-Browser Stopwatch / Pomodoro Timers:** Study community members use Yeolpumta (YPT) or physical timers on phones. In-browser web timers distract and invite anti-cheat complications.
- ❌ **No Grace Passes / Freeze Days:** Formally rejected. Deficits must be recovered dynamically via the Catch-Up model.

## 7. Foundational Product & Stack Laws (Non-Negotiables)

These nine foundational laws govern all implementation choices. They apply unconditionally to every agent:

### Law L1: Single Entity & Mathematical Unity
- **Rule:** Solos, Duos, and Squad battles are mathematically identical. A "Solo" is a `Team` where `maxMembers = 1`. A "Duo" has `maxMembers = 2`. All scoreboard aggregation queries group over `Team` entities.
- **Rationale:** Prevents fragmented codebases and duplicate calculation logic for different battle modes.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Creating separate `SoloLeaderboard` and `TeamLeaderboard` tables or calculation services.

### Law L2: Spreadsheet Exorcism & Zero Manual Arithmetic
- **Rule:** If a community host has to open Google Sheets, perform manual addition, or calculate catch-up deficits by hand, the platform has failed.
- **Rationale:** The core mission is curing moderator burnout by automating event setup, tracking, standings, and punishment enforcement.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Exporting raw unaggregated data that forces the host to calculate totals outside the application.

### Law L3: The Catch-Up Deficit Model (Zero Grace Passes)
- **Rule:** Grace passes and freeze days do not exist. If a participant logs fewer hours than their daily requirement, the deficit accumulates into their remaining days:
  $$\text{Remaining Deficit} = \max(0, \text{Target Seconds} - \text{Logged Seconds})$$
  $$\text{Required Daily Pace} = \frac{\text{Remaining Deficit}}{\text{Days Remaining}}$$
- **Rationale:** Community study battles reward sustained weekly effort and allow redemption without arbitrary pass mechanics.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Decrementing "pass tokens" or pausing tracking on specific days.

### Law L4: Discord Identity Primacy
- **Rule:** Users authenticate exclusively via Discord OAuth 2.0. Display names, Discord Snowflakes, and avatar URLs are synchronized on login. Spectators can view all public challenge data without logging in.
- **Rationale:** Zero onboarding friction for Discord community members; eliminates password reset flows and credential security burdens.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Adding username/password registration forms or requiring login to view the public scoreboard.

### Law L5: Admin Override Absolute
- **Rule:** Community hosts possess unconditional authority to manually adjust any participant's logged hours, edit goal descriptions, pardon punishments, or finalize results. Every manual edit is flagged with `is_override = true` and the host's `adminId`.
- **Rationale:** In real-world challenges, timers crash, apps bug out, and real-life emergencies happen. The host is the ultimate referee.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Creating immutable participant records that cannot be corrected by an administrator.

### Law L6: Dual-Failure Accountability Invariant
- **Rule:** At event conclusion, a participant is automatically flagged for punishment (`PUNISHED`) if **either** condition fails:
  $$\text{Is Punished} = (\text{Logged Seconds} < \text{Target Seconds}) \lor (\text{Incomplete Goals} > 0)$$
- **Rationale:** Studying without clear goals is aimless; declaring goals without studying is hollow. Accountability demands meeting both commitments.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Granting a pass when hours are met but declared goals are ignored, or vice versa.

### Law L7: Pure Domain Isolation (Inward Dependency Rule)
- **Rule:** All calculation math (hours-to-seconds conversions, deficit rates, standings rankings, punishment checks) must reside in pure TypeScript functions inside `domain/` with zero imports from Next.js, React, Prisma, or external UI libraries.
- **Rationale:** Enables instant, isolated Vitest unit testing without database spinning or framework mock overhead.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Embedding score calculations or deficit math directly inside React UI components or database route handlers.

### Law L8: Second-Level Clock Precision
- **Rule:** All study times are stored internally as integer total seconds and formatted in UI views as standard clock format (`HH:MM:SS` or `Xh Ym Zs`).
- **Rationale:** Yeolpumta (YPT) logs down to the second. Floating-point hours (e.g. `4.33h`) introduce rounding discrepancies that erode participant trust.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Storing durations as `Float` numbers in PostgreSQL or displaying raw unformatted seconds to participants.

### Law L9: Zero-State & Error Resilience
- **Rule:** Every UI view, data card, and table must provide polished visual designs for all three transient states: Loading (skeleton animation), Empty (helpful call-to-action), and Error (clear recovery prompt).
- **Rationale:** Prevents layout shifting, blank white screens, and unhandled promise rejections.
- **Forbidden Anti-Pattern:** Leaving data grids blank or displaying unstyled browser errors when data is missing or loading.

## 9. Agent Toolchain & Verification Protocol

### 9.1 Verification Commands
Before concluding any session or merging any pull request, agents must execute and verify:
```bash
# 1. Type Safety (Zero Errors)
npm run typecheck

# 2. Domain Unit Tests & Math Verification (100% Green)
npm run test

# 3. Production Build Validation
npm run build
```

### 9.2 Session Documentation Mandate
Once active codebase implementation begins and `HANDOFF.md` is instantiated at repository root, the active agent must update `HANDOFF.md` at the conclusion of each engineering session:
- Record session date and concise summary of changes.
- Update milestone progress table.
- Declare the exact, unambiguous **NEXT STEP** for the incoming agent.
