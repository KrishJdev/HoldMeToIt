## 3. Module Specifications: Authentication & Identity

### §3.1 Discord OAuth 2.0 Authentication `[P0]`
- **User Flow:** User visits landing page $\rightarrow$ clicks "Login with Discord" $\rightarrow$ grants `identify` scope $\rightarrow$ redirected back with session.
- **Data Captured:** Discord Snowflake ID, username, global display name, avatar URL hash.
- **Persistence:** Upserts record into `User` table; synchronizes avatar and display name on every login.
- **Access Roles:** Default role `PARTICIPANT`. First user or server admin flagged as `ADMIN`.

### §3.2 Public Read-Only Spectator Mode `[P0]`
- **User Flow:** Anyone visiting `/challenge/:id` without an active session can view the live match scoreboard, participant hours, and download the punishment PFP.
- **Security Invariant:** Write actions (logging hours, checking goals, editing rosters) are disabled and hidden for unauthenticated guests.

### §3.3 Multi-Guild Tenant Isolation `[V2]`
- **Description:** Adds optional `guild_id` to `Challenge` and `User` models, preparing the codebase to be installed across multiple independent Discord communities without data leakage.

---

## 4. Module Specifications: Challenge Operations & Lifecycle

### §4.1 Multi-Format Challenge Creator `[P0]`
- **Route:** `/admin/challenges/new`
- **Supported Formats:**
  1. `TEAM_VS_TEAM`: Two named rosters (e.g. *Bees vs Butterflies*).
  2. `DUOS`: Pairs of $N=2$ accountability partners.
  3. `SOLOS`: Free-for-all individual leaderboard ($N=1$).
- **Configuration Fields:** Title, Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Format, Team Names/Colors, Participant Assignment, Punishment PFP image URL/asset.

### §4.2 Host Manual Event Kickoff Trigger `[P0]`
- **Mechanism:** Even after the scheduled start time arrives, the host retains a "Start Event Now" button to verify all rosters and declared goals before locking inputs.
- **State Transition:** Moves challenge from `UPCOMING` to `ACTIVE`. Locks all target hours and goal descriptions.

### §4.3 Automated Countdown Timer & Expiration `[P1]`
- **Mechanism:** Background scheduler checks active challenge end timestamps.
- **Automated Transition:** When the countdown hits `00:00:00`, challenge automatically transitions to `COMPLETED`, freezes logging forms, and executes the punishment calculation routine.

### §4.4 Auto-Balancer Snake Draft & 15-Hour Cap `[V1]`
- **15-Hour Sanity Cap:** System rejects any declared target $>15\text{ hours/day}$ ($>105\text{ hours/week}$).
- **Draft Algorithm:**
  - Calculates composite rating: $R_i = 0.6 \times \text{DeclaredTarget} + 0.4 \times \text{HistoricalDailyAverage}$.
  - Sorts participants and runs a snake draft ($A, B, B, A, A, B\dots$) to produce evenly matched teams.
  - **Host Override:** Drag-and-drop roster editor lets mods swap participants before launching.

### §4.5 Event Lock & Finalize Results `[P0]`
- **Route:** `/admin/challenges/:id`
- **Action:** Host clicks "Lock Final Results". Freezes all participant data rows and triggers the final punishment evaluation.

### §5.2 Mandatory Weekly Goals Checklist `[P0]`
- **Requirement:** Each participant must submit between $1$ and $10$ concrete text tasks (e.g., *"Finish Organic Chemistry ch 4–6"*).
- **Hard Condition:** Every declared task must be checked off before the challenge concludes to avoid punishment.

### §5.3 Pre-Kickoff Declaration Lock `[P0]`
- **Invariant:** When the event status becomes `ACTIVE`, all targets and task descriptions become read-only for participants.

### §5.4 Host Goal Unlock & Mid-Event Edit `[P0]`
- **Purpose:** Accommodate real-life syllabus shifts or illness.
- **Action:** Admins can open any participant's goal sheet to add, edit, or unlock a task mid-challenge.

### §7.3 Dynamic Daily Catch-Up Deficit Engine `[P0]`

- **Dual-Credit Invariant:**
  1. **Personal Profile / Badges:** Always awards **100% full credit** for all logged hours.
  2. **Team Match Score:** Hours beyond daily target apply a half-weight damping factor ($\alpha = 0.5$):
     $$\text{If } L \le T_{\text{daily}}: \quad \text{TeamScore} = L$$
     $$\text{If } L > T_{\text{daily}}: \quad \text{TeamScore} = T_{\text{daily}} + 0.5 \times (L - T_{\text{daily}})$$

## 12. Deliberately Excluded / Rejected Features

The following features were evaluated and deliberately excluded based on user feedback:
- ❌ **Native In-Browser Study Timer (Pomodoro/Stopwatch):** Excluded because members study on diverse mobile devices where YPT is preferred.
- ❌ **In-App Virtual Study Rooms:** Excluded because community members already study inside Discord voice/video channels.
- ❌ **Automated Discord Role Assignments (Roles for Winners/Losers):** Excluded for now to avoid server role clutter.
- ❌ **Grace Passes / Freeze Days:** Excluded in favor of the pure cumulative catch-up deficit model.
